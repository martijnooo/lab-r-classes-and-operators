# Task 1: Create a Custom S3 Class

-   Define a custom S3 class called "Circle" that represents a circle. The class should store the radius of the circle.
-   Write a constructor function Circle() that takes the radius as input and assigns the class "Circle" to the object.
-   Write a print.Circle() method to display the radius and area of the circle when the object is printed. Use the formula for the area of a circle: area = Ï€ \* radius\^2.

```{r} 
# Define a constructor for the class
Circle <- function(x) {
  structure(x, radius = radius, class = "Circle")
}

circle <- Circle(x, 5)

circle <- list(radius=5)
class(circle) <- "Circle"
```
